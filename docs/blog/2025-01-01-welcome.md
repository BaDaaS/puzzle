# Welcome to Puzzle

We're excited to announce the official documentation site for **Puzzle** - your
comprehensive, privacy-first asset management platform.

## What is Puzzle?

Puzzle is a Django-based asset management application designed for businesses
and sole traders who need meticulous asset tracking and management. Unlike
centralized platforms, Puzzle respects your privacy and gives you complete
control over your financial data.
